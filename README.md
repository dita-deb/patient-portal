# patient-portal

## Overview
This repository provides a mock **Patient Portal System**, designed to simulate the functionality of real-world patient information management. Each portal presents patient health data in a user-friendly format, making it accessible for quick reference.

The system is part of the **LocIT Health Portal**, developed as a companion interface to the **LocIT user safety device and app**. It aims to improve safety and efficiency in emergency situations by providing essential patient information at a glance.

## Features
- **Individual Patient Portals**: Each patient has a dedicated page with structured and styled information.
- **Comprehensive Data**: Portals include critical information such as:
  - Personal details (name, age, blood type)
  - Allergies
  - Medical history with diagnosis dates and medications
  - Emergency contact details
- **Ease of Navigation**: Simple links direct users to each patient's portal for seamless access.

## How to Use
This mock system is hosted on **GitHub Pages**, allowing users to view patient portals via their browser. To access a specific patient's information:

1. Use the URL format below:

https://dita-deb.github.io/patient-portal/patient-X.html


3. Replace `X` with the patient number (e.g., `patient-1`, `patient-2`, etc.).

### Available Patient Portals
- [Patient 1](https://dita-deb.github.io/patient-portal/patient-1.html)
- [Patient 2](https://dita-deb.github.io/patient-portal/patient-2.html)
- [Patient 3](https://dita-deb.github.io/patient-portal/patient-3.html)
- [Patient 4](https://dita-deb.github.io/patient-portal/patient-4.html)
- [Patient 5](https://dita-deb.github.io/patient-portal/patient-5.html)
- [Patient 6](https://dita-deb.github.io/patient-portal/patient-6.html)
- [Patient 7](https://dita-deb.github.io/patient-portal/patient-7.html)
- [Patient 8](https://dita-deb.github.io/patient-portal/patient-8.html)
- [Patient X](https://dita-deb.github.io/patient-portal/patient-X.html)

## Why This Mock System is Great for LocIT
- **Simplified Information Access**: Our goal is to integrate this system with the **LocIT user safety device and app**, ensuring that critical patient information is readily available for caregivers and emergency personnel.
- **Training and Simulation**: This portal system is ideal for testing and demonstrating how **LocIT** can manage real-world patient data safely and effectively.
- **Scalable Design**: Easily adaptable for real implementations, this system can support many users, enhancing the scope of **LocIT**'s safety features.
- **Emergency Response Integration**: By providing vital medical and emergency contact information in an organized manner, this portal aligns with **LocIT's mission** to improve safety during critical situations.

## Future Development
This system serves as a prototype for future development of the **LocIT Health Portal**, which will include:
- Secure authentication for patients and medical staff.
- Dynamic data updates via integration with the **LocIT device**.
- Real-time health monitoring and alerts.

We are excited to take this mock system further as we continue to innovate for user safety and health management.
